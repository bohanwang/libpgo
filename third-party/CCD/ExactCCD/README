Exact CCD: Efficient Geometrically Exact Continuous Collision Detection

Released into the public domain by Tyson Brochu and Robert Bridson, 2012.

To make the library, edit the Makefile if needed and then run make; a static library file will be created.  This together with header file "rootparitycollisiontest.h" provides C++ access to the CCD routines.  

To use, create a RootParityCollisionTest object by specifying the vertex positions at the time step beginning and end times, and whether the test should be edge-vs-edge or vertex-vs-triangle, then call run_test() on the object.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Compiler optimizations may cause incorrect behaviour by assuming properties of floating-point arithmetic which do not actually hold, or by using 80-bit extended-precision registers. It has been tested with GCC 4.2.1 on Mac OS X with the -O2 flag set.
